## My opinion about Static site generators

Using Static Site Generators(SSG) when producing a website really saves us time. In this exam we for example makes blogpost on a website, and all we have to do is to create a file inside a folder and write in markdown what we want to say. We don’t need to do any links on any other website, the links to our post will be generated. We can use a common layout for all blog posts and control all our post common design through it. Our header and footer will follow us through every site but we will only write the code once. Our SSG will take care of the generating of the code to every site. We get a beautiful structure in our folders where all posts, layouts, sites and “plugins” are structured in folders and different files. This makes it easy to change the site in a small amount of time. And the generated site will be free from slow loading databases and only hold code that is made for browser reading. 
SSG only generates static sites which means that the site isn’t very changeable for anyone else than the programmers. It wouldn’t be a very great idea to build facebook or twitter using this technique where user input is a vast majority of the sites content. There will be no databases for users to upload data to. But a blog, like we do in this exam, is a very good type of page to use SSG. The only user input we use is the possibility to comment and this, we link to servers at disqus. A newspaper could do the same. News can be uploaded through our SSG and comments can be linked in from the outside. The news company can categorise their content and show it in chronological order. Though I am uncertain if it could be a problem if the news site contains very big amounts of data and updates on the site with new etc. needs to be made every 30 minutes. We can also use SSG for sites holding web presentations, event pages, pages for projects, company sites containing abouts and info and much more.
