Hi friends!

My name is Joel and i'm a student att the Linnaeus University in Kalmar, in Sweden.
I am studying Web Programmer and i have no experiences from before so it's alot to learn which makes it both harder and alot more fun, when everything i do is something new. 
In my spare time i often spend time with my girlfriend and my friends.
My girlfriend and I just moved to Kalmar and we both have our roots in Växjö so we often go to Växjö turing the weekends to meet our families and friends. 

You can find more information about me on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joelcarlss) profile
